### Task 3:
######  Implemented code to blink each LED light for 2 seconds in the order (Red, Yellow, Green), (code file: led_task3.py).
1. Added two more LED lights, two resistors, 4 wires. 
2. Yellow LED light connected to port 10, and Green LED light connected to port 11

* Circuit is fully functional
